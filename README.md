The CaptureLogMenu library (consisting of cLogMenu.h and cLogMenu.cpp) is intended to be used in conjuntion with the
CaptureLog library. The CaptureLogMenu library implements a C++ class that enables selective printing of capture
logs via a simple character-based menu that utilizes the Serial Monitor (or equivalent terminal emulator).
